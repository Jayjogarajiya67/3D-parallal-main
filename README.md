🚀 Using HTML & CSS in GitHub Projects

GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on code — perfect for web development projects like your Random Quote Generator or future business sites.

🗂️ Typical Project Structure

Here's how a basic HTML/CSS project might look in a GitHub repository:

/my-website/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── README.md

index.html: The main webpage

style.css: Your styling rules

script.js: Optional JavaScript for interactivity

README.md: Project description and instructions

📦 Steps to Upload Your HTML/CSS Project

Create a GitHub account (if you haven’t already)

Create a new repository: Click “New” and name your project

Upload your files:

Use the web interface to drag and drop

Or use Git commands:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
git push -u origin main

🌐 Hosting with GitHub Pages

You can turn your HTML/CSS project into a live website!

🔹 How to Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to your repository’s Settings

Scroll to Pages

Choose the branch (usually main) and folder (/root)

Save — GitHub will give you a live URL like:

https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/

🧠 Bonus Tips for Jay

Since you're working on structured documentation and front-end clarity:

Use comments in your HTML/CSS to explain sections

Add a README.md with:

Project purpose

Features

How to run it

Screenshots (optional)
